# ProjectEuler

## Description
My solutions for problems for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

## Usage

Navigate to problem folder and simply run **make**:
```
$ make
```

This will create an executable with a problem number as it's name, hence you can run it as (for example, if you compiled problem 0001):
```
$ ./0001.out
```

## Note

For certain problems, you will need to have GMP library installed.
