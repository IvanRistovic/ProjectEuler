# Problem 11
# In the 20x20 grid below, four numbers along a diagonal line have been marked in red.
# (check 0011.txt)
# The product of these numbers is 26 x 63 x 78 x 14 = 1788696.
#
# What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20x20 grid?
