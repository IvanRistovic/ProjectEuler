/*
	Problem 44

	Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn = n(3nâˆ’1)/2.
	The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

	1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

	It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8.
	However, their difference, 70 - 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

	Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and
	difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk - Pj| is minimised; what is the value
	of D?
