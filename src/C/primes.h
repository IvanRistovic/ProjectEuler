/*
 A library that works with prime numbers made for Project Euler tasks.
 All of the functions are optimized for speed, and most of them do not check
 their arguments. It is recommended to check the manual before using these functions

 NOTE: Compile with -lm
 NOTE: The bit operators are often used for multiplication/division by multiples of 2
